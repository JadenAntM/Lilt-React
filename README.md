Created a React website for a social media influencer that has over 300K followers on TikTok and Instagram. The client wanted a simple responsive website that displayed all of her links to various social media. I also added an embedded TikTok within the website.

## Features

- User-friendly design
- Buttons for all the client's desired links
- An embedded TikTok that plays when the page has been loaded
- Added a Christmas branch
    - Christmas theme colors
    - Added flashing Christmas lights

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
